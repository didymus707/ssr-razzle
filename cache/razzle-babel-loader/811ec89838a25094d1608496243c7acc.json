to us. Here's the\n      rundown of what we collect and why, when we access your information, and your rights.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. In this\n      policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to\n      your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Simpu Inc including Simpu (all\n      versions).\n    </p>\n\n    <section id=\"what-we-collect\">\n      <h2>What we collect and why</h2>\n      <p>\n        Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice\n      </p>\n      <h3>Identity & access</h3>\n      <p>\n        When you sign up for a Simpu product, we typically ask for identifying information such as\n        your name, email address, and maybe a company name. That’s just so you can personalize your\n        new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We\n        sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products,\n        but we do not normally look at or access that picture. We’ll never sell your personal info\n        to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your\n        permission either.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Billing information</h3>\n      <p>\n        When you pay for a Simpu product, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so\n        we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card\n        is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn't ever go through our servers. We\n        store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card\n        number and as-of billing address, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We\n        store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States, to detect\n        fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Geolocation data</h3>\n      <p>\n        We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no\n        unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your product\n        account is active.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We also log full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. We keep this record forever\n        because they are used to mitigate spammy signups.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions section — are also tied\n        temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases. We blind all web analytics\n        data after 30 days.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Website interactions</h3>\n      <p>\n        When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares\n        certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We\n        track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which\n        website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs.\n        We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web\n        analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed\n        into our Services. We blind all of these individual identifiers after 30 days.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Cookies and Do Not Track</h3>\n      <p>\n        easier for you to use our applications, and support some in-house analytics. A cookie is a\n        piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site\n        preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser.

Sometimes when we do customer\n        interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference\n        or use. We only do so if you give your express consent\n      </p>\n    </section>\n    <section id=\"what-we-dont-collect\">\n      <h2>Information we do not collect</h2>\n      <p>\n        We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race,\n        gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and\n        mental abilities or disabilities.

Simpu recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited\n        by applicable law. These rights include: <br />\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"bold\">Right to Know</span>\n            You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold.\n            We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they\n            are used, in this privacy policy.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"bold\">Right of Access</span>\n            This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and\n            your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of\n            that information.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"bold\">Right to Correction</span>\n            You have the right to request correction of your personal information.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"bold\">Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”</span>\n            This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that\n            your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our\n            service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using\n            Simpu services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data\n            deletion request may result in closing your account.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"bold\">Right to Complain</span>\n            You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal\n            information with the appropriate supervisory authority.

This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance\n            of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your\n            explicit consent.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"bold\">Right to Non-Discrimination </span>\n            This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to\n            use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer\n            service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of\n            certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising\n            those rights, prevent you from using our Services.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account\n        information.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at\n        [privacy@simpu.co](mailto:privacy@simpu.co) or at Simpu, Inc, 30 w 181st, 10453, New York,\n        USA. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been\n        collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of\n        information already collected including your user email address.

The\n        database backups are also encrypted. Most data are not encrypted while they live in our\n        database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great\n        lengths to secure your data at rest.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our [security\n        overview]\n      </p>\n    </section>\n    <section id=\"data-deletion\">\n      <h2>When you delete data in your product accounts</h2>\n      <p>\n        In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash data. Anything you trash on\n        your product accounts while they are active will be kept in an accessible trash can for up\n        to 30 days (it varies a little by product). After that, the trashed data are no longer\n        accessible via the application and are deleted from our active servers within the next 30\n        days. We also have some backups of our application databases, which are kept for up to\n        another 30 days. In total, when you trash things in our applications, they are purged within\n        90 days from all of our systems and logs. Retrieving data for a single account from a backup\n        is cost-prohibitive and unduly burdensome so if you change your mind you’ll need to do so\n        before your data are deleted from our active servers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We also delete your data after an account is cancelled. In this case, there is no period of\n        data being kept in an accessible trash can so your data are purged within 60 days. This\n        applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-cancelled\n        accounts. Please refer to our [Cancellation policy] for more details.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n    <section id=\"privacy-shield\">\n      <h2>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy</h2>\n      <p>\n        The GDPR requires that data transfer out of the EU must only happen to countries deemed as\n        having adequate data protection laws.
