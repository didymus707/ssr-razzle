Any use of the API,\n        including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is\n        bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following specific terms:{\" \"}\n        <br />\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any\n            damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party\n            products that access data via the API.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality\n            is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or\n            reports a Service user's activity *other than time tracking*, both\n            inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole\n            discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this\n            bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for\n            the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove\n            that integration.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API\n            may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your\n            account's access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion,\n            will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to\n            suspend your account's access, we will attempt to warn the account\n            owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may\n            cut off access without prior notice.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Some third-party providers have created integrations between our\n        Services and theirs.
