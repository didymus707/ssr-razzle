Term</h3>\n      <p>\n        When you sign up for an account and agree to these Terms, the Agreement\n        between you and Simpu is formed, and the term of the Agreement (the\n        “Term”) will begin. The Term will continue for as long as you have a\n        Simpu account or until you or we terminate the Agreement in accordance\n        with these Terms, whichever happens first. If you sign up for an account\n        on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that\n        you have the authority to accept these Terms and enter into the\n        Agreement on its behalf.\n      </p>\n      <h3>3. Closing Your Account</h3>\n      <p>\n        You or Simpu may terminate the Agreement at any time and for any reason\n        by terminating your Simpu account or giving notice to the other party.\n        We may suspend the Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If\n        we terminate your account without cause, and your account is a paid\n        account, we’ll refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment for\n        a Monthly Plan or reimburse you for unused Pay as You Go Credits. We\n        won’t refund or reimburse you in any other situation, including if your\n        account is suspended or terminated for cause, such as for a breach or\n        violation of the Agreement. If your account is inactive for 24 or more\n        months, we may terminate your account and you won’t be entitled to a\n        refund for a prepaid month or reimbursement for unused Pay as You Go\n        Credits. Once your account is terminated, you acknowledge and agree that\n        we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with\n        it, including your Campaigns. Usernames are unique and can only be used\n        once. If your account has been terminated, the username will no longer\n        be available for use on any future accounts and cannot be reclaimed.\n      </p>\n      <h3>4. Changes</h3>\n      <p>\n        We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms on our Simpu\n        Site. Unless you terminate your account, the new Terms will be effective\n        immediately upon posting and apply to any continued or new use of the\n        Service. We may change the Service, Add-ons, or any features of the\n        Service at any time, and we may discontinue the Service, Add-ons, or any\n        features of the Service at any time.\n      </p>\n      <h3>5. Account and Password</h3>\n      <p>\n        You’re responsible for keeping your account name and password\n        confidential. You’re also responsible for any account that you have\n        access to and any activity occurring in such account (other than\n        activity that Simpu is directly responsible for that isn’t performed in\n        accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that\n        activity. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized access or use\n        of your accounts. We’re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or\n        hacked passwords. We don’t have access to your current password, and for\n        security reasons, we may only provide you with instructions on how to\n        reset your password. We have the right to update any of your contact\n        information in your account for billing purposes. In addition, you\n        represent and warrant that all information you provide to us when you\n        establish an account, and when you access and use the Service, is and\n        will remain complete and accurate.\n      </p>\n      <h3>6. Account Disputes</h3>\n      <p>\n        We don’t know the inner workings of your organization or the nature of\n        your personal relationships. You won’t request access to or information\n        about an account that’s not yours, and you’ll resolve any\n        account-related disputes directly with the other party. We decide who\n        owns an account based on a number of factors, including the content in\n        that account, and the contact and profile information listed for that\n        account. In cases where differing contact and profile information is\n        present or we are unable to reasonably determine ownership, we’ll\n        require you to resolve the matter through proper channels outside of\n        Simpu.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When a dispute is identified, we may suspend any account associated with\n        the dispute, including disabling login and sending capabilities, to\n        protect the security and privacy of the data held within the account\n        until the dispute is properly resolved.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"payment\">\n      <h2>Payment</h2>\n      <p className=\"bold\">\n        If you had a paid Monthly Plan on or before May 15, 2019, the following\n        Section 7 may not apply to you and your account. If it does not apply,\n        an alternate version of Section 7 applicable to you and your account is\n        available in your account (navigate to “Account,” then “Billing,” then\n        “Monthly plans or credits”)\n      </p>\n      <h3>7A. Paid Monthly Plans</h3>\n      <p>\n        When you sign up for a paid monthly plan, you are required to\n        self-select both your projected audience, as described in Section 7B\n        below, and your package (e.g., Essentials, Standard, Premium) (together,\n        your “Monthly Plan”) from those posted on our Simpu Site based on your\n        anticipated use of the Service. Each Monthly Plan offers different\n        pricing and feature options. Once you select your Monthly Plan, Simpu\n        will never automatically upgrade or downgrade your Monthly Plan. So,\n        give yourself room to grow if you’ll need it! If you exceed your Monthly\n        Plan usage limits (either by exceeding your audience or monthly email\n        limits, or both), **you will incur additional charges** for the prior\n        billing cycle based on your current Monthly Plan, which will be detailed\n        on your bill and in your account. Before paying for your Monthly Plan\n        for the first time, you will have an opportunity to preview the\n        additional charges which would apply to your Monthly Plan should you\n        incur them by exceeding your self-selected usage limits. If you decide\n        to proceed, and you incur additional charges, you agree to pay them on\n        or before the next Pay Date, as described below. You will always have\n        the option to upgrade to a higher tier at any time. If you upgrade\n        during a billing cycle, you may elect to upgrade your package, your\n        audience limit, or both. If you elect to upgrade both, the upgrade\n        amount for the package upgrade is calculated first, and the upgrade\n        amount for the audience limit upgrade is calculated second. In any\n        event, your monthly charge for that billing cycle will be calculated\n        based on the number of days in that billing cycle during which you were\n        at each of the lower tier and the higher tier (including any applicable\n        additional charges for the higher tier). You will also have the option\n        to downgrade to a lower tier at any time, but if you elect to downgrade\n        during a billing cycle, your downgrade will not be effective until the\n        end of that billing cycle, and you will still be charged for that entire\n        billing cycle at the higher tier (including any applicable additional\n        charges for the higher tier).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When you sign up for a Monthly Plan, you agree to monthly recurring\n        billing, starting on the date you sign up. Billing occurs on the same\n        day each month, based on the date that you started your Monthly Plan.\n        Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day\n        you made your first monthly payment (the “Pay Date”). If any part of a\n        month is included in the Term, then payment is required for the full\n        month. If you exceed your self-selected usage limits for your Monthly\n        Plan, then you’ll have to pay additional charges (as described above)\n        for the prior billing cycle on or before the next Pay Date, even if the\n        Term ends or you downgrade to a Free Plan before that payment is\n        otherwise due. Billing for Monthly Plans may be paused, and you may\n        choose to close your account permanently at any time.\n      </p>\n      <h3>7B. Audience and Archiving</h3>\n      <p>\n        You may have several types of contacts in your Simpu account, but only\n        contacts that you can engage through the Service count as contacts in\n        your “audience” for purposes of your Monthly Plan or Free Plan.\n        Subscribed, unsubscribed, and non-subscribed contacts count towards your\n        audience. Cleaned, pending, reconfirmed, deleted, and archived contacts\n        do not count towards your audience. You may elect to archive contacts at\n        any time, but any profile changes for an archived contact (whether\n        initiated by you, the contact, or an integration) will automatically\n        unarchive that contact. You cannot engage in any activity through the\n        Service with archived contacts unless and until they are unarchived. If\n        a contact is unarchived, it will immediately count towards your audience\n        for your current billing cycle and any future billing cycles unless and\n        until archived again.\n      </p>\n      <h3>8. Free Plans</h3>\n      <p>\n        If you use the Service under the free plan (“Free Plan”) and you want to\n        go over the Free Plan limits, you’ll be required to upgrade your account\n        to, and select and pay for, a Monthly Plan. Monthly Plans are described\n        in Section 7A above. If you exceed your Free Plan limits, or otherwise\n        upgrade your account to a paid Monthly Plan, you’ll only be provided one\n        complimentary downgrade to the Free Plan (provided your sending volume\n        and audience numbers drop down to the Free Plan limits again). If you go\n        over the limits for the Free Plan more than once, you’ll no longer\n        qualify for the Free Plan, even if your future sending volume and\n        audience numbers are within the limits of the Free Plan.\n      </p>\n      <h3>9. Pay as You Go Credits</h3>\n      <p>\n        If you use the Service under the free plan (“Free Plan”) and you want to\n        go over the Free Plan limits, you’ll be required to upgrade your account\n        to, and select and pay for, a Monthly Plan. Monthly Plans are described\n        in Section 7A above. If you exceed your Free Plan limits, or otherwise\n        upgrade your account to a paid Monthly Plan, you’ll only be provided one\n        complimentary downgrade to the Free Plan (provided your sending volume\n        and audience numbers drop down to the Free Plan limits again). If you go\n        over the limits for the Free Plan more than once, you’ll no longer\n        qualify for the Free Plan, even if your future sending volume and\n        audience numbers are within the limits of the Free Plan.\n      </p>\n      <h3>10. Credit and Debit Cards</h3>\n      <p>\n        As long as you’re a Member with a Monthly Plan or otherwise have an\n        outstanding balance with us, you’ll provide us with valid debit or\n        credit card (“card”) information and authorize us to deduct your charges\n        against that card. You’ll replace the information for any card that\n        expires with information for a valid one. If your card is automatically\n        replaced with a new card by a payment processor, you acknowledge and\n        agree that we’re authorized to deduct any charges on your account\n        against the new card. Anyone using a card represents and warrants that\n        they are authorized to use that card, and that any and all charges may\n        be billed to that card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process\n        your card order, we’ll try to contact you by email and may suspend your\n        account until your payment can be processed.\n      </p>\n      <h3>11. Refunds</h3>\n      <p>\n        As long as you’re a Member with a Monthly Plan or otherwise have an\n        outstanding balance with us, you’ll provide us with valid debit or\n        credit card (“card”) information and authorize us to deduct your charges\n        against that card. You’ll replace the information for any card that\n        expires with information for a valid one.

Anyone using a card represents and warrants that\n        they are authorized to use that card, and that any and all charges may\n        be billed to that card and won’t be rejected.

Charges for Add-Ons</h3>\n      <p>\n        If you use an Add-on that has a charge, then you’ll be billed that\n        additional amount with each billing cycle for as long as the Add-on is\n        active. Your billing cycle for an Add-on may differ from your billing\n        cycle for your Monthly Plan or other features of the Service, and\n        certain Add-ons may require upfront payment for their entire billing\n        cycle. If you use Mandrill to send bulk emails in violation of our\n        Acceptable Use Policy, then we may charge you at the comparable Simpu\n        plan or terminate your account.\n      </p>\n      <h3>10. Billing Charges</h3>\n      <p>\n        We may change our fees, including our charges for Monthly Plans and Pay\n        as You Go Credits, at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our\n        Simpu Site or in your account and/or sending you a notification by\n        email. Quoted fees don’t include sales or other transaction-based taxes\n        of any kind.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"rights\">\n      <h2>Rights</h2>\n      <h3>14.
