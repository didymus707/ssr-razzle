      The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. Here's the
      rundown of what we collect and why, when we access your information, and your rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. In this
      policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to
      your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.
    </p>

    <p>
      This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Simpu Inc including Simpu (all
      versions).
    </p>

    <section id="what-we-collect">
      <h2>What we collect and why</h2>
      <p>
        Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice
      </p>
      <h3>Identity & access</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign up for a Simpu product, we typically ask for identifying information such as
        your name, email address, and maybe a company name. That’s just so you can personalize your
        new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We
        sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products,
        but we do not normally look at or access that picture. We’ll never sell your personal info
        to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your
        permission either.
      </p>
      <h3>Billing information</h3>
      <p>
        When you pay for a Simpu product, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so
        we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card
        is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn't ever go through our servers. We
        store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card
        number and as-of billing address, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We
        store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States, to detect
        fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices.
      </p>
      <h3>Geolocation data</h3>
      <p>
        We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no
        unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your product
        account is active.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also log full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. We keep this record forever
        because they are used to mitigate spammy signups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions section — are also tied
        temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases. We blind all web analytics
        data after 30 days.
      </p>

      <h3>Website interactions</h3>
      <p>
        When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares
        certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We
        track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which
        website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs.
        We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web
        analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed
        into our Services. We blind all of these individual identifiers after 30 days.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies and Do Not Track</h3>
      <p>
        easier for you to use our applications, and support some in-house analytics. A cookie is a
        piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site
        preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To
        learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to
        manage and delete them, please visit <span className="link">www.allaboutcookies.org</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by
        browser plugins.
      </p>

      <h3>Voluntary correspondence</h3>
      <p>
        When you write Simpu with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence,
        including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference
        if you reach out in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer
        interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference
        or use. We only do so if you give your express consent
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="what-we-dont-collect">
      <h2>Information we do not collect</h2>
      <p>
        We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race,
        gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and
        mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you
        include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your
        user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that
        represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for
        your use alone.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="when-we-access">
      <h2>When we access or share your information</h2>
      <p>
        Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or
        share your info are:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">To provide products or services you've requested.</span>
            We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent
            necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third
            parties(Google, Shopify, Mambu, etc). Having sub-processors means we are using
            technology to access your data. No Simpu human looks at your data for these purposes. We
            also use some other processors for other business functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">
              To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.
            </span>
            If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will
            ask for your consent before proceeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">
              To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding [restricted uses].
            </span>
            Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last
            resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers
            and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities
            throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted
            purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">When required under applicable law.</span>
            If the appropriate law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal
            subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we
            flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data. And
            unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are
            made. ***We have never received a National Security Letter or Foreign Intelligence
            Surveillance Act (FISA) order
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If Simpu, Inc is acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if
        it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes
        subject to a different privacy policy.

      <p>
        Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located
        in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any
        information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Site,

      <h2>Your Rights With Respect to Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        At Simpu, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location.
        Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s
        General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in
        the US. Simpu recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited
        by applicable law. These rights include: <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Know</span>
            You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold.
            We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they
            are used, in this privacy policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right of Access</span>
            This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and
            your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of
            that information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Correction</span>
            You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”</span>
            This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that
            your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our
            service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using
            Simpu services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data
            deletion request may result in closing your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Complain</span>
            You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal
            information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific
            authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to
            <span className="link">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Restrict Processing</span>
            This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is
            used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we
            never have and never will sell your personal data).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Object</span>
            You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal
            information is processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Portability</span>
            You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right
            to transmit it to another party.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making</span>
            You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or
            similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated
            processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance
            of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your
            explicit consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="bold">Right to Non-Discrimination </span>
            This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to
            use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer
            service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of
            certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising
            those rights, prevent you from using our Services.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at
        [privacy@simpu.co](mailto:privacy@simpu.co) or at Simpu, Inc, 30 w 181st, 10453, New York,
        USA. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been
        collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of
        information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is
        corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the
        account holder before proceeding.

    <section id="security">
      <h2>How we secure your data</h2>
      <p>
        All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS] when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The
        database backups are also encrypted. Most data are not encrypted while they live in our
        database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great
        lengths to secure your data at rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our [security
        overview]
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="data-deletion">
      <h2>When you delete data in your product accounts</h2>
      <p>
        In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash data. Anything you trash on
        your product accounts while they are active will be kept in an accessible trash can for up
        to 30 days (it varies a little by product). After that, the trashed data are no longer
        accessible via the application and are deleted from our active servers within the next 30
        days. We also have some backups of our application databases, which are kept for up to
        another 30 days. In total, when you trash things in our applications, they are purged within
        90 days from all of our systems and logs. Retrieving data for a single account from a backup
        is cost-prohibitive and unduly burdensome so if you change your mind you’ll need to do so
        before your data are deleted from our active servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also delete your data after an account is cancelled. In this case, there is no period of
        data being kept in an accessible trash can so your data are purged within 60 days. This
        applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-cancelled
        accounts. Please refer to our [Cancellation policy] for more details.

    <section id="privacy-shield">
      <h2>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy</h2>
      <p>
        The GDPR requires that data transfer out of the EU must only happen to countries deemed as
        having adequate data protection laws. The United States generally doesn’t meet that
        requirement. [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/) is an agreement between
        certain European jurisdictions and the United States that allows for the transfer of
        personal data from the EU to the US. Participation in the Privacy Shield program is
        voluntary.
      </p>
      <p className="bold">
        We comply with the frameworks for EU, UK, and Swiss data that are transferred into the
        United States
      </p>
      <p>
        Simpu complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
        Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
        retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom,
        and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. We’ve certified to the Department of
        Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between
        the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield
        Principles take precedent. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our
        certification, please visit

      </p>
      <p>
        Simpu is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission
        (FTC) with regard to the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Privacy Shield Frameworks uphold specific principles, many of which are already outlined
        in the section on Your Rights. For clarity, pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, the
        following principles apply to all EU, UK, and Swiss data that has been transferred into the
        United States: <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Individuals have the right to access their personal data and to update, correct, and/or
            amend information that is incomplete. Individuals also have the right to request erasure
            of personal information that has been processed in violation of the principles.
            Individuals wishing to exercise these rights may do so by by signing in and directly
            updating your account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights
            or need assistance, please contact us at [privacy@simpu.co](mailto:privacy@simpu.co) or

          </li>
          <li>
            We remain liable for the onward transfer of personal data to third parties acting as our
            agents unless we can prove we were not a party to the events giving rise to the damages.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not sell personal data nor do we permit it to be used for reasons other than those
            for which it was originally provided. If this practice should change in the future, we
            will update this policy accordingly and provide individuals with opt-out or opt-in
            choice as appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may be required to release personal data in response to lawful requests from public
            authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>
