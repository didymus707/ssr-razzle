    <h3>A fair refund policy.</h3>
    <p className="italic">
      Bad refund policies are infuriating. We never want our customers to feel
      that way, so our refund policy is simple: If you're ever unhappy with our
      products for any reason, we'll take care of you.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of full refunds we’d grant</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you were just charged for your next month of service but you meant
          to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you forgot to cancel your account a couple months ago and you
          haven’t used it since then, we’ll give you a full refund for a few
          back months. No problem
        </li>
        <li>
          If you tried one of our products for a couple months and you just were
          not happy with it, you can have your money back
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of partial refunds or credits we’d grant</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you forgot to cancel your account a year ago, and there’s been
          activity on your account since then, we’ll review your account usage
          and figure out a partial refund based on how many months you used it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you upgraded your account a few months ago to a higher plan and
          kept using it in general but you did not end up using the extra
          features, projects, or storage space, we’d consider applying a
          prorated credit towards future months.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days
          in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took multiple days
          to get back to you, we’d issue a partial credit to your account.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Get in touch</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to a
      case-by-case basis. Send us a note, tell us what's up, and we'll work with
      you to make sure you’re happy.
