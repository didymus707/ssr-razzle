      By using Simpu or signing up for an account, you’re agreeing to these
      Terms, which will result in a legal agreement between you and Simpu Inc
      (“Agreement”). We’ll start with the basics, including a few definitions
      that should help you understand these Terms. Simpu (“Simpu,” “we,” or
      “us”) is an online marketing & communications platform (the “App”) that
      allows you to manage your contacts & list, and to create, send, and manage
      certain marketing campaigns, including, without limitation, SMSs and
      advertisements (each a “Campaign,” and collectively, “Campaigns”), among
      other things. The App is offered through our website, including 
      <span className="link">https://www.simpu.co</span>,{" "}
      <span className="link">https://paylink.simpu.co</span>, and{" "}
      <span className="link">https://blog.simpu.co</span>  and any other
      website or mobile application owned, operated or controlled by us (we’ll
      collectively refer to these as the “Simpu Site,” and together with the
      App, the “Service”)
    </p>

    <p>Simpu Inc is a Delaware corporation (“Simpu”).</p>
    <p>
      Simpu has employees, independent contractors, and representatives (“our
      Team”). As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity
      that’s a customer of the Service, you’re a “Member” according to this
      Agreement (or “you”)
    </p>

    <p>
      These Standard Terms of Use (“Terms,” including our Acceptable Use
      Policy, API Use Policy, Cookie Statement, Copyright and Trademark
      Policy, Data Processing Addendum, and Brand Guidelines define the terms
      and conditions under which you’re allowed to use the Service in accordance
      with the Agreement, and how we’ll treat your account while you’re a
      Member. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you must immediately
      discontinue your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some features of the Service are offered as add-ons to your Simpu account
      (“Add-ons”). Unless expressly stated otherwise, these Terms apply to the
      use of Add-ons. Some Add-ons are intended for particular use cases and may
      also have additional terms or restrictions (“Additional Terms”).
      Additional Terms for Add-ons can be found on our Simpu Site at{" "}
      <span className="link">simpu.co.com/terms-conditions</span>, and Members
      agree to the applicable Additional Terms at the time they choose to add
      the corresponding Add-on. Also note that a Member’s account may have
      access to unique features of the Service based on their historic usage or
      status.

    <p>
      If you download the App through the Apple App Store, Google Play or other
      app store or distribution platform (“App Provider”), you acknowledge and
      agree that: (i) these Terms are between us, and not with the App Provider,
      and that we are responsible for the Service, not the App Provider; (ii)
      the App Provider has no obligation to furnish maintenance and support
      services or handle any warranty claims; (iii) the App Provider is not
      responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party have relating
      to the App; and (iv) the App Provider is a third party beneficiary of

      <p>
        By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet all the
        requirements listed above, and that you won’t use the Service in a way
        that violates any laws or regulations. Note that by representing and

        eligibility requirements at any time
      </p>

      <h3>2. Term</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign up for an account and agree to these Terms, the Agreement
        between you and Simpu is formed, and the term of the Agreement (the
        “Term”) will begin. The Term will continue for as long as you have a
        Simpu account or until you or we terminate the Agreement in accordance
        with these Terms, whichever happens first. If you sign up for an account
        on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that
        you have the authority to accept these Terms and enter into the
        Agreement on its behalf.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Closing Your Account</h3>
      <p>
        You or Simpu may terminate the Agreement at any time and for any reason
        by terminating your Simpu account or giving notice to the other party.
        We may suspend the Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If
        we terminate your account without cause, and your account is a paid
        account, we’ll refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment for
        a Monthly Plan or reimburse you for unused Pay as You Go Credits. We
        won’t refund or reimburse you in any other situation, including if your
        account is suspended or terminated for cause, such as for a breach or
        violation of the Agreement. If your account is inactive for 24 or more
        months, we may terminate your account and you won’t be entitled to a
        refund for a prepaid month or reimbursement for unused Pay as You Go
        Credits. Once your account is terminated, you acknowledge and agree that
        we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with
        it, including your Campaigns. Usernames are unique and can only be used
        once. If your account has been terminated, the username will no longer
        be available for use on any future accounts and cannot be reclaimed.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms on our Simpu
        Site. Unless you terminate your account, the new Terms will be effective
        immediately upon posting and apply to any continued or new use of the
        Service. We may change the Service, Add-ons, or any features of the
        Service at any time, and we may discontinue the Service, Add-ons, or any
        features of the Service at any time.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Account and Password</h3>
      <p>
        You’re responsible for keeping your account name and password
        confidential. You’re also responsible for any account that you have
        access to and any activity occurring in such account (other than
        activity that Simpu is directly responsible for that isn’t performed in
        accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that
        activity. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized access or use
        of your accounts. We’re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or
        hacked passwords. We don’t have access to your current password, and for
        security reasons, we may only provide you with instructions on how to
        reset your password. We have the right to update any of your contact
        information in your account for billing purposes. In addition, you
        represent and warrant that all information you provide to us when you
        establish an account, and when you access and use the Service, is and
        will remain complete and accurate.
      </p>
      <h3>6. Account Disputes</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t know the inner workings of your organization or the nature of
        your personal relationships. You won’t request access to or information
        about an account that’s not yours, and you’ll resolve any
        account-related disputes directly with the other party. We decide who
        owns an account based on a number of factors, including the content in
        that account, and the contact and profile information listed for that
        account. In cases where differing contact and profile information is
        present or we are unable to reasonably determine ownership, we’ll
        require you to resolve the matter through proper channels outside of
        Simpu.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a dispute is identified, we may suspend any account associated with
        the dispute, including disabling login and sending capabilities, to
        protect the security and privacy of the data held within the account
        until the dispute is properly resolved.

      <h2>Payment</h2>
      <p className="bold">
        If you had a paid Monthly Plan on or before May 15, 2019, the following
        Section 7 may not apply to you and your account. If it does not apply,
        an alternate version of Section 7 applicable to you and your account is
        available in your account (navigate to “Account,” then “Billing,” then
        “Monthly plans or credits”)
      </p>
      <h3>7A. Paid Monthly Plans</h3>
      <p>
        When you sign up for a paid monthly plan, you are required to
        self-select both your projected audience, as described in Section 7B
        below, and your package (e.g., Essentials, Standard, Premium) (together,
        your “Monthly Plan”) from those posted on our Simpu Site based on your
        anticipated use of the Service. Each Monthly Plan offers different
        pricing and feature options. Once you select your Monthly Plan, Simpu
        will never automatically upgrade or downgrade your Monthly Plan. So,
        give yourself room to grow if you’ll need it! If you exceed your Monthly
        Plan usage limits (either by exceeding your audience or monthly email
        limits, or both), **you will incur additional charges** for the prior
        billing cycle based on your current Monthly Plan, which will be detailed
        on your bill and in your account. Before paying for your Monthly Plan
        for the first time, you will have an opportunity to preview the
        additional charges which would apply to your Monthly Plan should you
        incur them by exceeding your self-selected usage limits. If you decide
        to proceed, and you incur additional charges, you agree to pay them on
        or before the next Pay Date, as described below. You will always have
        the option to upgrade to a higher tier at any time. If you upgrade
        during a billing cycle, you may elect to upgrade your package, your
        audience limit, or both. If you elect to upgrade both, the upgrade
        amount for the package upgrade is calculated first, and the upgrade
        amount for the audience limit upgrade is calculated second. In any
        event, your monthly charge for that billing cycle will be calculated
        based on the number of days in that billing cycle during which you were
        at each of the lower tier and the higher tier (including any applicable
        additional charges for the higher tier). You will also have the option
        to downgrade to a lower tier at any time, but if you elect to downgrade
        during a billing cycle, your downgrade will not be effective until the
        end of that billing cycle, and you will still be charged for that entire
        billing cycle at the higher tier (including any applicable additional
        charges for the higher tier).
      </p>
      <p>
        When you sign up for a Monthly Plan, you agree to monthly recurring
        billing, starting on the date you sign up. Billing occurs on the same
        day each month, based on the date that you started your Monthly Plan.
        Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day
        you made your first monthly payment (the “Pay Date”). If any part of a
        month is included in the Term, then payment is required for the full
        month. If you exceed your self-selected usage limits for your Monthly
        Plan, then you’ll have to pay additional charges (as described above)
        for the prior billing cycle on or before the next Pay Date, even if the
        Term ends or you downgrade to a Free Plan before that payment is
        otherwise due. Billing for Monthly Plans may be paused, and you may
        choose to close your account permanently at any time.
      </p>
      <h3>7B. Audience and Archiving</h3>
      <p>
        You may have several types of contacts in your Simpu account, but only
        contacts that you can engage through the Service count as contacts in
        your “audience” for purposes of your Monthly Plan or Free Plan.
        Subscribed, unsubscribed, and non-subscribed contacts count towards your
        audience. Cleaned, pending, reconfirmed, deleted, and archived contacts
        do not count towards your audience. You may elect to archive contacts at
        any time, but any profile changes for an archived contact (whether
        initiated by you, the contact, or an integration) will automatically
        unarchive that contact. You cannot engage in any activity through the
        Service with archived contacts unless and until they are unarchived. If
        a contact is unarchived, it will immediately count towards your audience
        for your current billing cycle and any future billing cycles unless and
        until archived again.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Free Plans</h3>
      <p>
        If you use the Service under the free plan (“Free Plan”) and you want to
        go over the Free Plan limits, you’ll be required to upgrade your account
        to, and select and pay for, a Monthly Plan. Monthly Plans are described
        in Section 7A above. If you exceed your Free Plan limits, or otherwise
        upgrade your account to a paid Monthly Plan, you’ll only be provided one
        complimentary downgrade to the Free Plan (provided your sending volume
        and audience numbers drop down to the Free Plan limits again). If you go
        over the limits for the Free Plan more than once, you’ll no longer
        qualify for the Free Plan, even if your future sending volume and
        audience numbers are within the limits of the Free Plan.
      </p>
      <h3>9. Pay as You Go Credits</h3>
      <p>
        If you use the Service under the free plan (“Free Plan”) and you want to
        go over the Free Plan limits, you’ll be required to upgrade your account
        to, and select and pay for, a Monthly Plan. Monthly Plans are described
        in Section 7A above. If you exceed your Free Plan limits, or otherwise
        upgrade your account to a paid Monthly Plan, you’ll only be provided one
        complimentary downgrade to the Free Plan (provided your sending volume
        and audience numbers drop down to the Free Plan limits again). If you go
        over the limits for the Free Plan more than once, you’ll no longer
        qualify for the Free Plan, even if your future sending volume and
        audience numbers are within the limits of the Free Plan.
      </p>
      <h3>10. Credit and Debit Cards</h3>
      <p>
        As long as you’re a Member with a Monthly Plan or otherwise have an
        outstanding balance with us, you’ll provide us with valid debit or
        credit card (“card”) information and authorize us to deduct your charges
        against that card. You’ll replace the information for any card that
        expires with information for a valid one. If your card is automatically
        replaced with a new card by a payment processor, you acknowledge and
        agree that we’re authorized to deduct any charges on your account
        against the new card. Anyone using a card represents and warrants that
        they are authorized to use that card, and that any and all charges may
        be billed to that card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process
        your card order, we’ll try to contact you by email and may suspend your
        account until your payment can be processed.
      </p>
      <h3>11. Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        As long as you’re a Member with a Monthly Plan or otherwise have an
        outstanding balance with us, you’ll provide us with valid debit or
        credit card (“card”) information and authorize us to deduct your charges
        against that card. You’ll replace the information for any card that
        expires with information for a valid one. If your card is automatically
        replaced with a new card by a payment processor, you acknowledge and
        agree that we’re authorized to deduct any charges on your account
        against the new card. Anyone using a card represents and warrants that
        they are authorized to use that card, and that any and all charges may
        be billed to that card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process
        your card order, we’ll try to contact you by email and may suspend your
        account until your payment can be processed.
      </p>
      <h3>10. Charges for Add-Ons</h3>
      <p>
        If you use an Add-on that has a charge, then you’ll be billed that
        additional amount with each billing cycle for as long as the Add-on is
        active. Your billing cycle for an Add-on may differ from your billing
        cycle for your Monthly Plan or other features of the Service, and
        certain Add-ons may require upfront payment for their entire billing
        cycle. If you use Mandrill to send bulk emails in violation of our
        Acceptable Use Policy, then we may charge you at the comparable Simpu
        plan or terminate your account.
      </p>
      <h3>10. Billing Charges</h3>
      <p>
        We may change our fees, including our charges for Monthly Plans and Pay
        as You Go Credits, at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our
        Simpu Site or in your account and/or sending you a notification by
        email. Quoted fees don’t include sales or other transaction-based taxes
        of any kind.

      <h3>18. Reporting Abuse</h3>
      <p>
        If you think anyone is violating any of these Terms, please notify us
        immediately. If you received spam you think came from a Simpu Member,
        please report it to our Abuse Team. (Every email Campaign sent through
        the Service has an embedded campaign tracking ID in the email header,
        making it easy to report suspected spam.) If you think anyone has posted
        material that violates any protected marks or copyrights, then you can
        notify us at the address provided in our Copyright and Trademark Policy.
      </p>
      <h3>19. Bandwidth Abuse/Throttling</h3>
      <p>
        You may only use our bandwidth for your Content and Campaigns. We
        provide image and data hosting only for your use of the Service, so you
        may not host images on our servers for anything else. We may throttle
        your sending or connection through our API at our discretion.

        all applicable laws and regulations. You’re responsible for determining
        whether the Service is suitable for you to use in light of your
        obligations under any regulations like HIPAA, GLB, Data Protection Laws
        Data Processing Addendum, United States export control laws and
        regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations (“U.S. Export
        Control Laws and Regulations”), or other applicable laws. If you’re
        subject to regulations (like HIPAA) and you use the Service, then we
        won’t be liable if the Service doesn’t meet those requirements. You may
        not use the Service for any unlawful or discriminatory activities,
        including acts prohibited by the Federal Trade Commission Act, Fair
        Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act Children's Online
        Privacy Protection Act or any other applicable laws.

        In addition, if you are subject to EU Data Protection Law (as defined in
        the Data Processing Addendum), you acknowledge and agree that we have
        your prior written authorization to respond, at our discretion, to any
        data subject access requests we receive from your contacts made under EU
        Data Protection Law, or, alternatively, we may direct any such contacts
        to you so that you can respond to the request accordingly
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any losses, including
        all legal fees and expenses, that result from your breach of this

      </p>
      <h3>Export Controls</h3>
      <p>
        The software that supports the App (the “Software”) is subject to U.S.
        Export Control Laws and Regulations. Export laws are set up by the U.S.
        government to keep certain goods and services from reaching other
        countries, usually because of security concerns or trade agreements.
        None of the Software may be downloaded or otherwise exported or
        re-exported in violation of U.S. Export Control Laws and Regulations and
        any other applicable export laws and regulations (collectively, “Export
        Control Laws”). Therefore, you agree that you won’t, directly or
        indirectly through a third party, allow the Software or your Campaigns
        to be accessed or generated from within, or distributed or sent to, any
        prohibited or embargoed country as mentioned in any Export Control Laws.
        In addition, you certify that neither you nor any principals, officers,
        directors, or any person or entity you know to be directly involved with
        the use of the Service is designated on any U.S. government list of
        prohibited or restricted persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s important to note that this Section 21 isn’t meant to provide a
        comprehensive summary of the Export Control Laws that govern Simpu, the
        Service, or the Software. You’re downloading and using the Software at
        your own risk, and it’s your responsibility to consult with a legal
        adviser to make sure your use of the Service and the Software complies
        with applicable laws.

      <p className="bold">
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that

        and our Team won’t be liable for any indirect, punitive, special, or

        and (iii) in any calendar month, our total liability to you arising
        under or in connection with the Agreement—whether in contract, tort
        (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise—will be
        no more than what you paid us for the Service the preceding month.
      </p>
      <p className="bold">
        For the avoidance of doubt, in no instance will we or our Team be liable
        for any losses or damages you suffer if you use the Service in violation
        of these Terms, regardless of whether we terminate or suspend your
        account due to such violation
      </p>

      <h3>23. No Warranties</h3>

        provide warranties, conditions, or undertakings of any kind in relation
        to the Service, either express or implied. This includes, but isn’t
        limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
        purpose, which are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded

        losses, including legal fees and expenses that directly or indirectly
        result from any claims you make that are not allowed under these Terms
        due to a “Limitation of Liability” or other provision. (Indemnity is an
        agreement to compensate someone for a loss.) You also agree to indemnify
        and hold us harmless from any losses, including legal fees and expenses,
        that directly or indirectly result from (i) your Content, (ii) your use
        of the Service, (iii) your violation of any laws or regulations, (iv)
        third-party claims that you or someone using your password did something
        that, if true, would violate any of these Terms, (v) any

        or warranties you’ve made to us.

      <h3>25. Equitable Relief</h3>
      <p>
        Your violation of these Terms may cause irreparable harm to us and our
        Team. Therefore, we have the right to seek injunctive relief or other
        equitable relief if you violate these Terms (meaning we may request a
        court order to stop you).
      </p>
      <h3>26. Subpoena Fees</h3>
      <p>
        Your violation of these Terms may cause irreparable harm to us and our
        Team. Therefore, we have the right to seek injunctive relief or other
        equitable relief if you violate these Terms (meaning we may request a
        court order to stop you).
      </p>
      <h3>27. Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>
        We and our Team aren’t responsible for the behavior of any third
        parties, agencies, linked websites, or other Members, including
        third-party applications, products, or services for use in connection
        with the Service (each, a “Third-Party Integration”). Your use of any
        Third-Party Integration and rights with respect to such Third-Party
        Integration are solely between you and the applicable third party. We

        Third-Party Integration or the practices and policies of any Third-Party
        Integration. We make no warranties of any kind and assume no liability
        of any kind for your use of any Third-Party Integration.

      <h3>34. Interpretation</h3>
      <p>
        The headers and sidebar text are provided only to make these Terms

        at some point
      </p>
      <h3>36. No Changes in Terms at Request of Member</h3>
      <p>
        Because we have so many Members, we can’t change these Terms for any one

        you with information about that incident so that you can evaluate the
        consequences to you and any legal or regulatory requirements that may
        apply to you, unless we’re prevented from doing so by legal, security or
        confidentiality obligations. Notifying you of a security incident or
        cooperating with you to respond to one will not be deemed an
        acknowledgement or assumption of any liability or fault of Simpu for
        such incident.
      </p>
