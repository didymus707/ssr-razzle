      All the terms that you agree to when you sign up for a Simpu product
    </p>
    <p>
      From everyone at Simpu, thank you for using our product! We built Simpu to
      be the one toolkit for running your business. Right now, there are lots of
      businesses using Simpu every day. Because we don't know every one of our
      customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to
      help keep the ship afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are
      referring to Simpu, Inc.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by
      Simpu, Inc. That includes Simpu (all versions), whether delivered within a
      web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Typically these
      changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded
      related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we
      will also announce them on our company blog
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the
      latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future
      products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may
      be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the
      Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision.
      <span className="bold italic">
        These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you violate of any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's
      a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We
      do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are, and
      keeping an open door to your feedback

      <h2>Account Terms</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
            password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
            damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We
            recommend users set up [two-factor authentication] for added
            security. In some of our Services, we may require it.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our Use

          <li>
            You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
            under your account. That includes content posted by others who
            either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their
            own logins under your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other
            automated methods are not permitted.

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really
            free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for
            customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of
            trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in
            advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze
            your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If
            your account has been frozen for a while, we will queue it up for
            auto-cancellation. See our [Cancellation policy] for more details.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge
            your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of
            upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new
            rate starts from the next billing cycle.
          </li>
          <li>
            All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
            taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
            behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
            authorities. See our [Taxes policy] for more details. Otherwise, you
            are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.
          </li>
          <li>We process refunds according to our [Fair Refund policy]</li>

      <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.
            Within each of our Services, we provide a simple no-questions-asked
            cancellation link. You can find instructions for how to cancel your
            account in our [Cancellation policy]. An email or phone request to
            cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If
            you need help cancelling your account, you can always [contact our
            Support team].
          </li>
          <li>
            All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services
            immediately upon cancellation. Within 30 days, all content will be
            permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60 days,
            all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We cannot
            recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
            month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will
            not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in
            the last billing cycle. See our [Fair Refund policy] for more
            details.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
            any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at
            any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account
            will not be able to access the account or any content in the
            account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your
            account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and
            relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the
            right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at
            any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of
            the hundreds of thousands of potential accounts on our Services,
            there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some
            things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise
            that stance. For more details, see our [Use Restrictions policy].

          <li>
            Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse

            immediate account termination.

      <p>
        <ul>

            We make a promise to our customers to support our Services [until
            the end of the Internet](../until-the-end-of-the-internet/index.md).
            That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support,
            we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it
            becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign
            a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we
            decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at
            any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any
            part of our Services with or without notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products or
            features. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from
            those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for
            existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days
            notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may
            also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected
            Services themselves

            We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your

            taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may

            customers.

          <li>
            We take many measures to protect and secure your data through
            backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for
            data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge
            cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted.
            Please refer to our [Security Overview]for full details.

        We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the
        experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However,
        there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no
        guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As
        with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the
        bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any
        related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and
        we don't guarantee completely error-free Services.

    <section id="services-adaptations-api">
      <h2>Services Adaptations and API Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We offer Application Program Interfaces ("API"s) for some of our
        Services (currently for Simpu's Transactional SMS. Any use of the API,
        including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is
        bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following specific terms:{" "}
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any
            damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party
            products that access data via the API.
          </li>
          <li>
            Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality
            is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or
            reports a Service user's activity *other than time tracking*, both
            inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole
            discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this
            bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for
            the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove
            that integration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API
            may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your
            account's access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion,
            will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to
            suspend your account's access, we will attempt to warn the account
            owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may
            cut off access without prior notice.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some third-party providers have created integrations between our
        Services and theirs. We are not liable or accountable for any of these
        third-party integrations.

        You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable,

        exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of
        profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the
        Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting
        from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of

        passive), or any other theory of liability.

        In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a

        our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management
        of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent;
